# Form-Validation

I followed a YouTube tutorial on how to make a clean looking form that validates input. There are three types of validation:

1. Is the field blank?
2. Is the email in a proper email format
3. Does the retyped password match the first password

This is definitely not original work, but I went through all the steps are recreated it myself so I at least wanted to put it up here.
